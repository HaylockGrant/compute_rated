Modifications and additions made by Grant Haylock (https://github.com/HaylockGrant/compute_rated):

1. Concept Change: Transformed from a token bucket algorithm for request-based rate limiting 
   to a leaky bucket algorithm optimized for compute time limits.

2. New Functions: 
   - add_compute_time/4
   - wait_for_capacity/5

3. Modified Functions:
   - check_rate/4 (adapted for compute time)
   - Removed inspect_bucket/3

4. Algorithm Changes:
   - Implemented time-based leaking of compute time
   - Added calculations for leak rate and remaining capacity

5. Data Structure: Modified to store compute time instead of request counts

6. Error Handling: Updated to include current and remaining compute time in responses

7. Waiting Mechanism: Added functionality to wait for available capacity

8. Time Handling: Simplified timestamp generation

9. Naming: Changed module and application names from ExRated to ComputeRated

10. Documentation: Updated to reflect focus on compute time management

11. Dependencies: Removed some development dependencies

12. Project Metadata: Updated version, description, and repository links
